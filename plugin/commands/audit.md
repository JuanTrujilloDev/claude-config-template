# /audit

Run a comprehensive code-quality + security audit on the codebase or a specific scope.

## Usage

```
/audit          # entire codebase
/audit <path>       # specific dir or file
/audit <branch>      # specific branch's diff against main
```

## Steps

### Phase 1: Plan
1. Identify files in scope
2. Check repo size: total files, recently changed files
3. List the audit categories you'll cover

### Phase 2: Code review
Spawn `code-reviewer` against the scope. Capture findings.

### Phase 3: Security review
Spawn `security-reviewer` against the scope. Capture findings.

### Phase 4: Test health
- Run `your project's test command` — all green?
- Coverage at ≥80%?
- Identify untested critical paths

### Phase 5: Tooling health
- `your project's format command` clean?
- `your project's lint command` clean?
- Dependency security: any known CVEs?
